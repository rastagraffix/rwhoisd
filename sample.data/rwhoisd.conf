#
# Main RWhois Configuration File
#

# all configuration options have the form <tag>: <value>.

# root-dir (also 'default-dir'): This is the directory that rwhoisd
# will chroot() to if chrooting isn't turned off.  It is also the
# directory that rwhoisd will assume all relative paths are relative
# to. If it is not set, it will default to the current working
# directory.
# normal default is ""
# NOTE:  you want to change this.

root-dir: /home/databases/rwhoisd

# bin-path: Where to find extra binaries.

# This file is required.
# normal default is "rwhoisd.auth_area"

# directives.  This file is required.
# normal default is "rwhoisd.dir"

# ("X-") directives.  This file is optional.
# normal default is rwhoisd.x.dir

# max-hits-default: The starting value for the hit limit.  It can be
# changed with the -limit directive.  
# normal default is 20

# max-hits-default: 20

# punt-file: used by the punt (or "up") referral.
# normal default is "rwhoisd.root"

# punt-file: rwhoisd.root

# local-host:  What we want the local host to be known as.  This is
# primarily for the welcome banner and for determining whether a
# %see-also can be locally resolved.  If omitted, rwhoisd will attempt
# derive the value

# local-host: rwhois.a.com

# local-port: The advertised port that rwhoisd listens to.  The IANA
# assigned port for RWhois is 4321 (and so that is the default).

# local-port: 4321

# The tcp_wrappers allow list for rwhoisd.  The "daemon" parameters
# refers to the directive.  "rwhoisd" refers to connections to the
# server itself. This is optional.
# normal default is "/etc/hosts.allow"

# security-allow:/etc/hosts.allow
security-allow: rwhoisd.allow

# The tcp_wrappers deny list for rwhoisd.  See the comments for

# deadman-time: The number of seconds of idle-time before the server
# automatically disconnects.

# secondary server
# normal default is "daemon" which is recommended

# server-type: inetd
# server-type: standalone

# chrooted: Whether or not we should chroot.  Chrooting is recommended.
# normal default is  NO.
# chrooted: YES

# userid: If run as root, rwhoisd will change to this user and this
# users group, as found in /etc/passwd.

# normal default is "rwhoisd.pid"

# pid-file: /var/run/rwhoisd.pid
pid-file: rwhoisd.pid

# server contact: who to contact about problems related to the server
# itself.
# this option doesn't have a default.

# use-syslog: whether or not to log using syslog;
# if it isn't logging to syslog, it attempts to log to files (see below)
# normal default is YES

use-syslog: NO

# syslog-facility: the syslog facility to use (daemon, mail, news,
# etc.); default is 3 (daemon)

# syslog-facility: 3

# default-log-file: if not logging to syslog, use the default log file
# to log to if not overridden by at a particular level.
# normal default is "rwhoisd.log"

# default-log-file: rwhoisd.log

# <level>-log-file: if not logging to syslog, log messages at <level>
# to this file.  <level> is one of {emergency, alert, crit, err, warn,
# notice, info, debug}

# emergency-log-file: rwhois.crit.log
# alert-log-file:     rwhois.crit.log
# crit-log-file:      rwhois.crit.log
# err-log-file:       rwhois.err.log
# warn-log-file:      rwhois.err.log
# notice-log-file:    rwhois.info.log
# info-log-file:      rwhois.info.log
# debug-log-file:     rwhois.info.log

# verbosity: set the level at which you want logging to occur.  The
# higher the number, the more logging occurs.  The value is a number
# corresponding to the log level, where emergency is 0 and debug is
# 7. Setting verbosity to -1 will disable *all* logging, and setting
# it to 7 (or higher) will enable all logging.  The default is 6
# (info).  Another good value might be 5 (notice).

# verbosity: 6 # info

# max_children: set the maximum number of children to be forked at any
# given time.  This has the affect of limiting the number of
# simultaneous connections.  When the number of children exceeds this
# number, the server responds with an error code and disconnects.
# Zero for this value (the default) indicates that there is no
# maximum.

# max-children: 30

# the following configuration items relate to the use of PGP as a
# Guardian scheme.  If, at a minimum, pgp-uid and pgp-pwfile aren't
# filled out, then PGP will be disabled.

# pgp-uid: the userid string of the server itself (used to find the
# server's public/private key pair in the pgp keyrings.

# pgp-uid: rwhoisd@rwhois.net

# pgp-pwfile: the path to a file containing the password to the pgp
# server's private key

# pgp-pwfile: .pgppasswd

# pgp-bin-path: the path to the pgp binary.  This is used as a
# security feature, making it harder to interpose a bogus version of
# pgp.  If not set, it uses the server's PATH to find the binary.

# pgp-bin-path: /usr/local/bin/pgp

# pgp-keyring-path: the path to the directory containing the pgp
# public and private keyrings (pubring.pgp, secring.pgp, etc).
# Default is $HOME/.pgp
# note that this sets it to <root-dir>/.pgp

# pgp-keyring-path: .pgp
