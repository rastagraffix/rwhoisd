The ARIN release of this code in Github hasn't been touched
since its initial import in 2017.

This fork (rastagraffix/rwhoisd) exists promarily so I can clean
up the build environment (mostly, nuke all the unnecessary autoconf
stuff), and get the source tree into a more organized structure.
With that done it should be a lot easier to package this up for
/usr/ports builds on my servers.

I don't intend to change the functionality, but I will probably
do some additional cleanup as I go.  Feel free to email me with
bug reports or suggestions. (Put 'rastagraffix/rwhoisd' in the
Subject header, please.)
